Branching:

 | | mrs_serve - now merged with master

mrs_gp1_0.py - is the initial version, works with communicate, but
only get about a 4x speedup, which maybe isn't that nice.  possible
that it would be better with more asynchronous behavior.  mrs_gp.py is
the working version.

TODO for mrs_gp.py:
 - test on processes with errors, ....
 - os.times() - can this show children's time/CPU pct so I can see actual load?
 - server timeout, for security, in case I leave it running...?
 - add an 'abort task' method for server...? or maybe kill client thread?

ROBUSTNESS/ERRORS/DOCS:
 - writeup smallvoc-tfidf.py as an example
 -- should I round-trip serialized outputs, to make sure they can be read back in?
 -- better docs for Augment?
 -- document it needs unix, python 2.7
 -- document lack of UDF's

FUNCTIONALITY

to add:
 - allow --make as synonym for --store
 - write and document an efficient Count (see mrs_test/mrs-naive-bayes.py)
 - OutputOfShellCommand(command=[],sideviews=[],shipping=[])
 - OutputOfStreamingMapReduce(view1, mapper='shell command', reducer='shell command', combiner='shell command', sideviews=..., shipping=[f1,..,fk]) 
 --- define class StreamingMapReduce(MapReduce): which knows how to doExternalMap and doExternalReduce, etc via subprocesses
 --- this could be a gpextras view

   subclass of Augment, where inners=[], and rowGenerator runs the
   shell command as subprocess, stores the result, and then uses the
   ReadLines generator to produce the result

 - add user-defined Reuse(FILE) ? (why do I want this again? for make-style pipelines? is it really needed?)
 - gpextras, for debugging:
 -- PPrint?
 -- Wrap?
 -- WholeTextFiles?

 - cleanup
 -- standardize view.by argument
 -- clean up.gpmo and other tmp files? could do this via analysis at the AbstractMapReduceTask lst level
 -- log created views so you can continue with --reuse `cat foo.log|grep ^created|cut -f2`
 -- maybe add --config logging:warn,...

DOCS:
 - some longer examples for the tutorial (phirl-naive? tfidfs?)
 - document planner.ship, planner.setEvaluator
