FUNCTIONALITY

 - option(storedIn=FILE) - so you can retrieve and store work on s3
 - add Stream(view1, through='shell command', shipping=[f1,..,fk])
 - add StreamingMapReduce(view1, mapper='shell command', reducer='shell command', combiner='shell command', shipping=[f1,..,fk]) 
 - add user-defined Reuse(FILE) ? (why do I want this again?)

 - gpextras, for debugging:
 -- PPrint?
 -- Wrap?
 -- Describe?
 -- Illustrate?

 - efficiency
 -- combiners: add combiner as combiningTo=.. option of Group.  
 -- compression -jobconf mapred.output.compress=true -jobconf mapred.output.compression.codec=org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.GzipCode
 -- hadoop options (parallel, hopts, ...)

 - cleanup
 -- standardize view.by argument
 -- clean up.gpmo and other tmp files? could do this via analysis at the AbstractMapReduceTask lst level
 -- log created views so you can continue with --reuse `cat foo.log|grep ^created|cut -f2`
 -- maybe add --config logging:warn,...

DOCS:
 - some longer examples for the tutorial (phirl-naive?)
 - document planner.ship, planner.setEvaluator

TODO - MAJOR

- a GPig.registerCompiler('key',factoryClass), for adding new targets other than hadoop?
 - compiler for marime.py map-reducer with ramdisks (note: diskutil erasevolume HFS+ 'RAMDisk' `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://10315776`,
   size is in 2048-byte blocks)

- multithreading ideas

  1. for CPU intensive steps, include multithreaded ReplaceEach and Flatten ops,
     which sets up a work queue, and for each row, adds a task, and
     removes any completed tasks.

  2. add another compiler, which generates marime/mime.py steps.

  3. Implement: marime mr -m MAP -r RED -i IN -o OUT -k K 
           and: marime putsplit -i IN -o OUT -k K
	        marime getmerge -i IN -o OUT
  where in and out are ramdisk directories

  map setup if there are J files in I:
    K queues, Qi for shard i - ie {k,v : H(k)%K == i}
    J processes Pj, each will run 'MAP < in/shard.j | ...' -- or could use threads (subprocesses would be more modular)
    J threads to read from Pj.stdout and route (k,v) to appropriate Qi
    K threads, each to process inputs from one queue, into a shardBuffer

  when all map processes are done:
    K subprocesses, Ri, to run '... | RED > out/shard.k' -- or could use threads (subprocesses more modular)
    K threads to print from the shardBuffer to Ri

 - DESCRIBE(...) - could be just a pretty_print?

 - ILLUSTRATE(view,[outputs]) - using definition of view, select the
   inputs from the innerviews that produce those outputs.  Then, do that
   recursively to get a test case.
